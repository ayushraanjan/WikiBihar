In the 'Bara massacre', 37 members of Bhumihar caste were slain by the Maoist Communist Centre. According to the report of India Today, Yadav leaders of Janata Dal were accused of instigating the violence against the Bhumihars after killing of ten Dalits in Barsimha village by "Savarana Liberation Front", an upper-caste organisation. A court later tried the perpetrators. The upper caste retaliated by killing 56 Dalits at Laxmanpur Bathe.[24][25] One of the main accused of the massacre, Ram Chandra Yadav was proven guilty in March 2023 in a trial Court of Bihar. The Maoist Communist Centre of India claimed that the killings were a response to attack on Dalits elsewhere, by the Savarna Liberation Front, another militant organisation.
