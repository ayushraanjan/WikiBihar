Bodh Gaya is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, situated in the Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar. It is famous for being the place where Gautama Buddha is said to have attained Enlightenment (Pali: bodhi) under what became known as the Bodhi Tree.[2] Since antiquity, Bodh Gaya has remained the object of pilgrimage and veneration, for Hindus and Buddhists both.[3] In particular, archaeological finds, including sculptures, show that the site was in use by Buddhists since the Mauryan period.
